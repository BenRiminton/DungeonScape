        Room(0) = "You awaken; you open your eyes to find yourself in a dim dungeon prison cell. You can barely see the rusted iron bars surrounding you. Perhaps you should try and find a way out of this cell, or you could just sit here and rot. You make out the door of your cell to the east. It doesn't look very strong."
        Room(1) = "As you step out of the cell you notice a corpse hanging on the wall by some iron chains. You can continue exploring the room to the south or go back into your cell which is to the west."
        Room(2) = "A guard is leaning back in his chair facing the wall ahead of you. He seems oblivious to your presence. A small candle is burning on his desk sending your shadow dancing across the walls around you. There is a door just to the east of the guard. I would suggest taking out the guard with something first. You could also return to the south."
        Room(3) = "You leave the guards office. You find yourself in a long narrow tunnel. The smell of moss makes you cough. The tunnel continues to the east. To the west is the guards office."
        Room(4) = "As you continue down the tunnel you feel the room temperature plummet. You accidentally step into a freezing cold puddle of a muddy solution. You know for sure this place is uninhabited by humans. To the west is a tunnel. To the east is the end of the tunnel."
        Room(5) = "You find yourself outside a large open doorway to the east. A small sign written in scrawly handwriting reads:'KCAB EMOC TNOD'. Perhaps its a code? To the west is the tunnel back to the guard's office."
        Room(6) = "As you step through the doorway, it seals itself behind you almost instantly. Then all goes silent. The room is empty apart from a large tablet in the centre of the room. As you get closer you notice a small stick of chalk beside the tablet. After closer examination you notice a riddle on the tablet, written in similar scrawly handwriting. It reads 'Say my name and I disappear. What am I?'. To the east is a locked door."
        Room(7) = "You enter a small square shaped room. As you enter a smell creeps up your nostrils making your eyes water. There is a strong smell of poison in the room. The floor is cluttered with gold coins and a red carpet leads to the centre of the room. At the centre lies a pedestal with a large chest on top. Upon closer inspection you notice the coins that surround you are just pebbles painted yellow. The whole room gives you the chills. As you step closer to the chest the smell gets stronger. Perhaps you should be careful opening this chest. Another door is located to the south."
        Room(8) = "Youve followed the noise to a dead end but you still cant locate the source. A small shimmer catches your eye. Its coming from the base of the wall. You bend down to inspect it closer. It seems to be a small mouse hole. You hear the squeaking again and an agitated rat runs past your face revealing a sparkling glint inside the hole. There is a door to the east."
        Room(9) = "You can still feel the eerie presence of the rotting corpse as you leave it behind. You then realise youve arrived at a crossroads of sorts. You feel the darkness begin to encompass you. To the east is a large strong door that is locked. It is too strong to break open. In the small crack underneath the door you see candlelight flickering and shadows moving. A sharp screeching noise grabs your attention which is followed by a quiet rustle. It came from the hallway to your west. You could also return to the north."

At the centre of the room is a desk. Upon it are 3 books. They all look similar apart from large gold numerals on the front cover of each book.

As you take a closer look at the room, you notice under the eerie purple light that the books are flying from shelf to shelf. Flapping their pages like wings as they glide across the room, seemingly ignoring your presence. Two books however are completely immobile and are placed on a podium to the south."

The walls are lined with the odd pipe here and there, they seem poorly maintained and have started leaking a glowing green goo from the joints.

Bubbles rise through the Slime and burst ontop creating the gargling noise you heard previously. It starts to drag it's gooey self towards you.
