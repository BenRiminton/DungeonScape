You awaken; you open your eyes to find yourself in a dim dungeon prison cell. You can barely see the rusted iron bars surrounding you thanks to the near extinguished torch on the wall on the other side of the bars. Perhaps you should try and find a way out of this cell, or you could just sit here and rot.
